## General Info

This repository stores the proposed solution for each exercise as part of a test to evaluate Programming and SQL skills.

The algorithms were developed in C++ by using Visual Studio 2019 environment and the SQL queries were implemented in a Microsoft Access as testing environment.

For each algorithm it was created a project on Visual Studio 2019 that contains the main() function and will be running the solution on a Windows Console Aplication. The projects can be opened individualy on Visual Studio, but there is also a Solution file which contains the three projects available to run. In case you choose to open the Solution file in a Visual Studio environment, remember to right-click on the project you want to run and select the option "Set as Startup Project" before running the application.
